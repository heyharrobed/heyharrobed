# Correction on Attendance


Hello Raju,
&nbsp;
<p>We appreciate you getting back to us regarding your attendance at our recent session. As you may have noticed, you’ve been tagged as absent in this session. This is because, though you have joined the class, you have only been in the session for 10 minutes. The class was scheduled for an hour and you were required to at least be present at least in half of the entire session.</p>

Just a quick review, as outlined in our [Course-Policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19#heading-attendance-and-coursework-submissions "Course Policies") we only allow a total of 3 absences. This goes both for excused and unexcused absences. Please be reminded that you could request your absence in advance through the [CodePath Course Portal](https://courses.codepath.com/sessions), just click on the Quick Actions drop-down and select Request Excused Absence. Also, unexcused absences (No Call, No Show) are discouraged and even one unrequested absence may result in you being removed from the course.

<p>We wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate and highlight one of our core values– attendance, an important component of this learning process which will ensure that you do not only develop the hard skills but also encourage committing your time to learn as this goes hand in hand with your work proficiency.</p>

<p>Hope this advice helps you moving forward as we would like to have you until the end of this course and see you master the skills that you were meant to excel in.</p>

&nbsp;

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
