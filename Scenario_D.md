# Self-initiated Withdrawals

Hello Ranchodas,
&nbsp;

<p>We’d like to sincerely congratulate you for being accepted into Microsoft’s internship program! We are very happy to hear of this new opportunity that has arisen for you. Though it is a shame to let go of a brilliant student like you, we are more than happy to support you embark on this new venture.</p>

<p>Also, please be advised that from active student, we are now moving you to an observer role in this course, which is described as the following:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>As an observer, you’ll still have lifetime access to our course material which would allow you to review at your pace.</li>
<li>As an observer, though you have access to the course material you will be subjected to self-review and will not be able to join the live sessions for the classes.</li>
<li>As an observer, we will no longer require any coursework outputs nor impose deadlines for you.</li>
</ol></p>

 
<p>Lastly, we would like to invite you to join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst"> Mailing List</a> to continue receiving updates on our upcoming courses and events which you may want to check out in the future once your schedule permits.</p>

<p>We are rooting for you and hopefully, we get to see you again soon!</p>
&nbsp;

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
