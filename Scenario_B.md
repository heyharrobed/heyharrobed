# Withdrawn student's request for reconsideration


Hello Pia,
&nbsp;

<p>We appreciate you reaching out to us regarding your interest in getting reconsidered to join the course this semester. We can see your eagerness in learning and we’d like to commend you for doing your best to catch up through session recordings and to submit your coursework requirements. However, as much we would like to let you finish this course, we have also considered the following important points in proceeding with this decision–</p>

<p><li><strong>Attendance</strong>. As an institution, we have stipulated in our <a href="https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19#heading-attendance-and-coursework-submissions"> Course Policy</a> how we greatly value attendance and how it is one of our educational models. We believe that practicing this commitment at all times throughout this course will not only promote the best learning experience for you but would also go hand in hand with developing proficiency in pursuing this industry.</li></p>
 
<p><li><strong>Your availability</strong>. At the moment, we understand how overwhelming it must be for you to manage your time given the full load you have this semester together with your workload on weekends, which unfortunately falls on the schedule as your class in CodePath Cyber Security course. It truly is not an easy feat, juggling work with this course activities. We wouldn’t want to overwork you and affect the time you need to take for yourself- an important component in maintaining the balance in life which helps greatly in developing your creativity and promotes productivity. This leads us to the last point–</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Quality output</strong>. Being overworked is never easy and in the long run may result in sacrificing the quality of your output, be it in your work performance or in your coursework requirements. And we wouldn’t want any of that for you.</li></p>

<p>It is indeed unfortunate for us to let you go but hopefully, this would make way for you to focus your energy on the given task at hand. Also, as an observer, you would still have lifetime access to the course material. This could alleviate the pressure of submitting weekly coursework and still gives you an opportunity to review at your most convenient time.</p>

<p>We would love to have you when you have a lesser load and better availability and hopefully, we can meet next semester!</p>

&nbsp;

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
